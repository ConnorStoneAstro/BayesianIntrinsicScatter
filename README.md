# Bayesian Intrinsic Scatter Example

This is a toy model example showing how Bayesian Intrinsic Scatters are calculated using the code from Stone et al. 2021a.

## Installation

simply clone the repository and start playing around:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ConnorStoneAstro/BayesianIntrinsicScatter.git
```

## Usage

To begin, just run the main script and see the results

```bash
python3 run_intrinsic_scatter.py
```
